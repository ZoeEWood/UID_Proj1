Zoe Wood * Spotify Search * HW1 * October 8, 2015

This application allows a user to search for a track in Spotify's database by specifying between 1 and 5 terms. 

~The Search Functionality~

	I designed the site to have 5 search bars, each one corresponding to a particular term. In order to use the search engine, the user may specify up to 
five terms before pressing search. The more terms, the more refined the search. This allows a user to have a very specific idea in mind of what they would
like to listen to, or a very vague notion. The reason for 5 separate search bars is error prevention: this way the user does not have to worry about 
forming a request in any particular way. 

~Aesthetic~

	I tried to make the site look something like Spotify; this corresponds to the "consistency and standards' 
heuristic. This way, users, will have some idea of what to expect when they first encounter my site, if they are used to Spotify 
already. 
	I also tried to keep the design as minimal as possible. Some of this minimalism was sacrificed by having 5 search bars, however, 
I decided that this was worth it due to the simplicity that lends to the actual search. Also in the name of minimalism, I designed the site 
so that the search bar is separate from the returned content, but that the returned content has a easy way of going back to the search bar, 
should the user want to search again. This way, the search bar is not cluttered by results, and vice versa, but there is a clear path between
the two. I designed it this way with "recognition rather than recall" in mind. 

~Content Loading and Arrangement~

	I struggled a bit with this. Originally, I wanted the site to scroll to the beginning of each new 10 elements, but I could not figure out 
how to do this in javascript, which was quite frustrating. Thus, it must be noted that, when new results load, it is necessary to scroll down in 
order to see the new content. I recognize that this is not ideal. Also, I could not figure out how to adjust the limit from 20 to 50, so it is only possible
to search through 20 results. 
	The content is accompanied by two buttons: "See more results from this Search!" and "Start Over." The first loads 10 more tracks, as is
discussed above, and "Start Over" brings the user back to a fresh search bar. This was designed with "User control and freedom" in mind, as it 
provides a clear way of going 'back.' 

Thank you for your comments :)
